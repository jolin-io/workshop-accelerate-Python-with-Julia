## mybinder.org

The links above will spawn jupyter notebook on mybinder.org. One CPU and 1-2 GB memory, just for you, thanks to the supporters of mybinder.org.


### Alternative local installation

If mybinder.org is down, or you like to have things locally, you can do so easily. (Note that the first run can take 5 minutes, after that it is instantly loaded from cache).

Install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`jupyter-repo2docker`](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), and then create your own local environment with the following command.
```
jupyter-repo2docker https://github.com/jolin-io/workshop-accelerate-Python-with-Julia
```
